# spotify-history

Archive your Spotify listening history into a lightweight SQLite3 database and receive daily listening summaries by email.  

- Every **5 minutes**, a Python script ([here](src/fetch_spotify.py)) runs via cron to fetch your recent Spotify listening history and upsert it into the SQLite3 database. 
- Every day at **midnight (12:01 AM)**, another Python script ([here](src/send_email.py)) runs via cron to query the database, compute daily overview metrics, and send you an email summary of your listening activity.  


## Example Data

Your listening history is saved in a local SQLite database (`plays.db` by default).  
Hereâ€™s a simple query and sample output:  

```bash
sqlite3 db/plays.db "SELECT played_at, track_name, artist_name, album_name FROM plays ORDER BY played_at DESC LIMIT 5;"
```
Output:
```yaml

played_at                 track_name      artist_name      album_name

## Requirements

### Operating System
- Supported: **macOS** and **Linux**  
- The service must run on a host that remains continuously powered and connected (e.g., dedicated server, VM, or Raspberry Pi).  
  - Example: Raspberry Pi Model B v1.1 (512MB RAM) running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit).  

### Runtime & Dependencies
- **Python 3.11**
- **SQLite3**
- [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.25.1/) (Spotify Web API client for Python)  
- **Cron** (for scheduling)  
- **Shell scripting**  
- [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) (built-in Python SMTP client)  

## Installation & Setup

Follow the steps below to install and configure the service.  

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcolanfranchi/spotify-history
cd spotify-history
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and fill in your own values:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Update .env with your configuration:
```bash
# Spotify API
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=abcdefg123456789
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=abcdefg123456789
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8888/callback

# SQLite
SQLITE_DB_NAME=plays.db

# Email notifications
NOTIFY_EMAIL=example@gmail.com
EMAIL_FROM=example@gmail.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=example@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=example
```

### 3. Install SQLite (if not already installed)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 -y
```

### 4. Create Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Initialize the Service
Run the setup script to initialize everything:
```bash
chmod +x ./run.sh
./run.sh
```
This script will:
- Create the SQLite database (if not already present) at [db/](db/) with the name <SQLITE_DB_NAME> (from `.env`)
- Apply the latest schema version from [db/sql/](db/sql/)
- Set up the required cron jobs
- Once the script completes, the service is fully installed and running.

## Monitoring & Logs
Logs from the cron-scheduled Python scripts are written to spotify.log in the project root. To view them:
```bash
cat spotify.log
```
